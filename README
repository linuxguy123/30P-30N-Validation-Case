This repository contains various resources necessary/helpful to validate the meshing and CFD simulation of a 30P-30N airfoil.

The impetus for this activity came from Wolf Dynamics 30P-30N validation case available here: http://www.wolfdynamics.com/tutorials.html?id=119

In their validation case WD meshed and simulated a 30P-30N airfoil at a 0 degree AoA at a Reynolds number of 5,000,000 using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model.  They obtained a Cd of 2.237588 and a CL of 0.034598 versus the experimental values of 2.167089 and 0.033243 respectively.

I am starting the repository out with the following files so that others may use them to validate various meshing and simulation tools they may be using. 

- 30P-30N-Validation.FCStd   
- 30P-30N-Validation-Windtunnel.{stl|brep|iges}
- 30P-30N-Validation-Wing.{stl|brep|iges}
- 30P-30N-{whole|Slat|Flap|Main}-raw.dat
- 30P-30N-{whole|Slat|Flap|Main}-Normalized.dat

The first file is a FreeCAD model of a 1m(nominal) 30P-30N wing and windtunnel along with a 2D CfdOF analysis object.  The other files are stl, iges and brep representations of the wind tunnel solid and the wing solid and wing profile files to recreate a 30P-30N airfoil.   

The normalized dat files have an overall chord of 1.0.  The non normalized dat files have a chord of ~1.2 with the slat starting prior to x=0 and the flap going beyond x=1.  The wing and wind tunnel models are not normalized.  I included normalized dat files because some airfoil tools expect airfoils to have a chord less than 1.0.

Note: The 30P-30N wing has a nominal chord of 1.0 when the slat and flap are retracted but an actual chord of ~1.2 when extended. All 30P-30N lift and drag figures are with respect to the nominal chord, not the actual chord.  If one simulates a normalized 30P-30N airfoil, one will need to multiply the forces and coefficients by ~1.2 to get the values used in industry. 

Helpful Information

The air velocity for Re of 5,000,000 flowing past a 1m airfoil is 90m/sec.  The reference pressure (rho/2*V^2) of std air at 90m/s is 4961 pa.

The 30P-30N airfoil is challenging to mesh and simulate because of its unique geometry and the airflows around those geometries.

I encourage people to contribute their validation solutions to this repository by creating new folders and including their own READMEs and solution files.
